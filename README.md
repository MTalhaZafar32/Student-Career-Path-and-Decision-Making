Student Career Path and Decision-Making Survey
This repository contains a project focusing on the challenges students face in making career decisions and their impact on overall well-being and academic performance. The project aims to explore the factors influencing career choices, students' confidence in their chosen paths, and their sentiments towards the decision-making process.

Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to understand the career decision-making process of students and how it can affect their academic success and well-being. The project comprises the following key components:

## Data Collection:
We conducted a survey named "Student Career Path and Decision-Making Survey," where we asked students ten categorical questions and an open-ended question regarding career counseling in educational institutions. The data collection process involved reaching out to students from different educational backgrounds and demographics.

## Data Cleaning:
After collecting the survey responses, we performed data cleaning to ensure the data's consistency and remove any irrelevant information or missing values. The cleaned data forms the basis for our analysis.

## Data Exploration: 
The data exploration phase involved generating descriptive statistics and visualizations to gain insights into students' career decision-making patterns, confidence levels, and opinions about the impact of career choices on their academic performance.

## Sentiment Analysis: 
We conducted sentiment analysis on the responses to the open-ended question about career counseling in educational institutions. This analysis aims to understand students' sentiments towards the effectiveness of career guidance programs and identify potential areas for improvement.
